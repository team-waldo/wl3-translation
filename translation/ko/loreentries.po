" One of the most persistent of Colorado's local fables is that of the Lady "
"in Blue.\\n"
"\\n"
"Starting only a few years after the world didn't quite end, the locals began "
"to encounter a woman who became known as the Lady in Blue.She would appear "
"at random from the perpetually-frozen wastes of Colorado, generally when "
"someone was in dire need of aid. She seldom spoke, but was always masked, "
"and always wore something blue. Over the years, she became something of a "
"local curiosity, but most put it up to one more eccentric survivor in a "
"world full of them.\\n"
"\\n"
"Then the village of Snowhaven was destroyed.\\n"
"\\n"
"Raiders calling themselves the Frostwolves descended upon the small, poorly -"
" defended village after its inhabitants refused to pay \"protection fees.\" "
"By the next morning, the entire village had been pillaged and burned, and "
"the inhabitants either murdered or enslaved and dragged back to the "
"Frostwolves' encampment in a nearby shopping mall.\\n"
"\\n"
"Three days later, raiders began to vanish. First, it was isolated patrollers "
"or drunks who wandered too far alone.Then a half-dozen man \"protection "
"detail\" failed to return from another nearby village. It came to a head "
"when someone started to pick the raiders off from extreme range with some "
"kind of railgun. Armed mostly carried bludgeons and a smattering of poorly-"
"maintained firearms, the Frostwolves were woefully outclassed. They pulled "
"back to the fortified shopping mall and holed up in one of the stores.\\n"
"\\n"
"It didn't help.\\n"
"\\n"
"In the space of twenty minutes, a single blue-scarved figure carrying an "
"antique katana swept through them like the angel of death. When the "
"surviving villagers emerged from the warehouse at the back of the store, "
"every single raider was dead, and their savior was vanishing into a "
"descending blizzard without a word.\\n"
"\\n"
"Who or what is the Lady in Blue? Some say an immortal super soldier. Others, "
"a synth. Still others say it is a title passed down along a succession of "
"women. No one knows, but to this day, bandits dislike anyone wearing "
"anything blue."

" 콜로라도의 지역 우화들 중 가장 되풀이되는 것 중 한 가지는 레이디 인 블루 이야기다.\\n"
"\\n"
"원주민들이 레이디 인 블루라 알려진 여자를 마주치기 시작했던 때는 세상이 완전히 끝나지 않았던 시기로부터 불과 몇 년이 지난 후였다. "
"일반적으로 누군가가 도움을 끔찍하게 필요로 할 때가 되면, 그녀는 영원토록 얼어붙은 콜로라도 황무지에서 불규칙적으로 출현했다. 그녀는 "
"거의 말을 하지 않았지만 항상 복면을 썼으며, 언제나 푸른색이 들어간 옷을 입었다. 여러 해 동안, 그녀는 지역의 호기심이 되었으나, "
"대부분의 사람들은 이 괴이이한 생존자들로 가득찬 세상에서 한 명이 더 늘어난 것일 뿐으로 치부했다.\\n"
"\\n"
"그리고 스노우헤이븐 마을이 파괴되었다. \\n"
"\\n"
"스스로를 프로스트울브즈라고 부르는 레이더들은 작고 형편없이 방어되고 있던 그 마을 거주민들이 '보호비'를 내는 것을 거부하자 습격해 "
"왔다. 다음 날 아침 마을 전체가 약탈되고 불살라졌으며, 주민들은 살해당하거나 노예가 되어 근처 쇼핑몰에 있는 프로스트울브즈의 야영지로 "
"끌려갔다.\\n"
"\\n"
"3일 후, 레이더들은 사라지기 시작했다. 첫 번째로, 너무 멀리 혼자 배회하던 순찰자들이나 술에 취한 이들이 고립되었다. 그리고 '보호 "
"임무'를 수행하던 6명의 레이더들이 인근 마을에서 돌아오지 못했다. 그 절정은 누군가 레일건 같은 걸로 극도로 먼 거리에서 레이더들을 "
"사냥하기 시작한 때였다. 프로스트울브즈들은 대부분 몽둥이나 형편없이 정비된 화기들을 장비하고 있었고, 그들은 비참하게 압도당했다. 그들은 "
"방비된 쇼핑몰로 후퇴하여 상점들 중 하나에 숨었다.\\n"
"\\n"
"그것은 도움이 되지 않았다.\\n"
"\\n"
"20분 동안, 오래된 카타나를 든 푸른색의 흉터가 있는 한 남자가 죽음의 천사처럼 그들을 휩쓸고 지나갔다. 레이더들이 하나도 남김없이 "
"죽은 후, 살아남은 마을 사람들이 상점 뒤쪽에 있는 창고에서 모습을 드러냈다. 그리고 그들의 구원자는 한 마디 말도 없이 내리는 눈보라 "
"속으로 사라졌다.\\n"
"\\n"
"레이디 인 블루는 누구 혹은 무엇인가? 어떤 이들은 불멸의 슈퍼 솔져라고 말한다. 다른 이들은 신스라고 말한다. 여전히 다른 이들은 "
"여자들이 뒤를 이을 때 물려받는 칭호라고 이야기한다. 누구도 모르지만, 오늘날까지 도적들은 푸른 색 뭔가를 입은 사람들을 좋아하지 않는다."
