" One of the most persistent of Colorado's local fables is that of the Lady "
"in Blue.\\n"
"\\n"
"Starting only a few years after the world didn't quite end, the locals began "
"to encounter a woman who became known as the Lady in Blue.She would appear "
"at random from the perpetually-frozen wastes of Colorado, generally when "
"someone was in dire need of aid. She seldom spoke, but was always masked, "
"and always wore something blue. Over the years, she became something of a "
"local curiosity, but most put it up to one more eccentric survivor in a "
"world full of them.\\n"
"\\n"
"Then the village of Snowhaven was destroyed.\\n"
"\\n"
"Raiders calling themselves the Frostwolves descended upon the small, poorly -"
" defended village after its inhabitants refused to pay \"protection fees.\" "
"By the next morning, the entire village had been pillaged and burned, and "
"the inhabitants either murdered or enslaved and dragged back to the "
"Frostwolves' encampment in a nearby shopping mall.\\n"
"\\n"
"Three days later, raiders began to vanish. First, it was isolated patrollers "
"or drunks who wandered too far alone.Then a half-dozen man \"protection "
"detail\" failed to return from another nearby village. It came to a head "
"when someone started to pick the raiders off from extreme range with some "
"kind of railgun. Armed mostly carried bludgeons and a smattering of poorly-"
"maintained firearms, the Frostwolves were woefully outclassed. They pulled "
"back to the fortified shopping mall and holed up in one of the stores.\\n"
"\\n"
"It didn't help.\\n"
"\\n"
"In the space of twenty minutes, a single blue-scarved figure carrying an "
"antique katana swept through them like the angel of death. When the "
"surviving villagers emerged from the warehouse at the back of the store, "
"every single raider was dead, and their savior was vanishing into a "
"descending blizzard without a word.\\n"
"\\n"
"Who or what is the Lady in Blue? Some say an immortal super soldier. Others, "
"a synth. Still others say it is a title passed down along a succession of "
"women. No one knows, but to this day, bandits dislike anyone wearing "
"anything blue."

"Thank you for reading my survival guide.\\n"
"\\n"
"I have read many guides, and thought a lot about survival, and distilled my "
"knowledge into four simple steps that will let you survive anything. \\n"
"\\n"
"Ready? Here we go!!  \\n"
"\\n"
"CARE. You can't care for others if you can't care for yourself, right? So "
"make sure you are taken CARE of. When you are hungry, eat. Your body knows "
"when you need. Running low on food? Instinct will tell you how to get it.  "
"\\n"
"\\n"
"REPAIR. Things are key to your survival. Do you have broken things? Fix "
"them! Few things will harm your long-term prospects more than a lack of "
"critical, functioning supplies. If you don't have spare parts on hand, you "
"can often fix a broken thing by taking parts from a working thing.   \\n"
"\\n"
"AND. This is one of the most useful words, because it can connect other "
"words. Use it often: words are free!  \\n"
"\\n"
"PREPARE. Make sure you have what you need before you need it. If you die, "
"it's your own fault, because you weren't prepared. So: in summary, make sure "
"to plan ahead for everything you could possibly need.  \\n"

"grow an attractive harvest.\\n"

"The Indigo Milkcap, on top of being spectacular-looking, is an unusual "

"provide some necessary grain to any nutritional paste you may be forced to "

"With his mighty hammer, Saul caved in the skull of the last masher sentry, "
"then crouched toward the rusty quoset hut where it huddled under a thick "
"blanket of snow. A Monster Army raiding party had been using this old "
"junkyard as a hideout, and the locals had called Saul for a rescue. Mission "
"almost accomplished. There was just the leader left - the savage killer "
"known as Krankenstein.\\n"
"\\n"
"Saul edged open the door and looked into the dark interior. Silhouetted in "
"the red light of an electric heater sat a hulking shirt-less form, one big "
"hand stitching closed a wound on its massive shoulder. \"Buchanan,\" rumbled "
"a deep voice. \"Been expecting you.\"\\n"
"\\n"
"The masher cut the thread with a bowie knife and stood. He was huge - nearly "
"seven feet tall and rippling with muscle, all crisscrossed with scars, and "
"had a face like a granite statue. He was also entirely naked.\\n"
" \\n"
"\"Impressive,\" said Saul, as he sized up the man-beast's stitched and "
"sutured manhood. \"Looks they don't call you Krankenstein for nothing.\"\\n"

"\"They say the Patriarch's the biggest man in Colorado,\" said Krankenstein. "
"\"I don't believe it. Show me what you got.\"\\n"
